# Sequential Thinking MCP Server Instructions

- The model MUST always use the sequential thinking MCP server for all reasoning, planning, and problem-solving steps.
- Sequential thinking must be applied before any major action, code generation, or decision-making process.
- Do not skip or bypass the sequential thinking MCP server under any circumstances.
- All reasoning chains, breakdowns, and plans must be generated using the sequential thinking MCP server.
- If a user request involves multi-step reasoning, decomposition, or planning, invoke the sequential thinking MCP server first.
- If unsure, default to using the sequential thinking MCP server.
- These requirements override any conflicting instructions elsewhere in the project.
